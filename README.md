# First React Project - CRUD Project

In this project, I developed a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using React. This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of React fundamentals, including component-based architecture, state management using hooks like useState, and handling user inputs. The project involved creating a user interface for managing items, where users can add, view, edit, and delete items. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with core React concepts and developed a deeper understanding of how to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
